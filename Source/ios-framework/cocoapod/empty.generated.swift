    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - directoryPath: The directory path in which ObjectBox places its database files for this store,
    ///     or to use an in-memory database `memory:<identifier>`.
    ///   - maxDbSizeInKByte: Limit of on-disk space for the database files. Default is `1024 * 1024` (1 GiB).
    ///   - fileMode: UNIX-style bit mask used for the database files; default is `0o644`.
    ///     Note: directories become searchable if the "read" or "write" permission is set (e.g. 0640 becomes 0750).
    ///   - maxReaders: The maximum number of readers.
    ///     "Readers" are a finite resource for which we need to define a maximum number upfront.
    ///     The default value is enough for most apps and usually you can ignore it completely.
    ///     However, if you get the maxReadersExceeded error, you should verify your
    ///     threading. For each thread, ObjectBox uses multiple readers. Their number (per thread) depends
    ///     on number of types, relations, and usage patterns. Thus, if you are working with many threads
    ///     (e.g. in a server-like scenario), it can make sense to increase the maximum number of readers.
    ///     Note: The internal default is currently around 120. So when hitting this limit, try values around 200-500.
    ///   - readOnly: Opens the database in read-only mode, i.e. not allowing write transactions.
    ///
    /// - important: This initializer is created by the code generator. If you only see the internal `init(model:...)`
    ///              initializer, trigger code generation by building your project.
