[ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io/) Swift is a superfast, light-weight object persistence framework for iOS and macOS.

This is the ObjectBox Swift **API reference**.
Also check the **[guides](https://swift.objectbox.io/)** for general documentation including [setup](https://swift.objectbox.io/install) and [getting started](https://swift.objectbox.io/getting-started).

Current version: 2.0.0

## Most Important Types

- `Store`: database entry point and source of `Box`es.
- `Box`: main interface to persist objects and create `Query`s.
- `Entity`: protocol to mark your type as persistable by ObjectBox.
- `Id`: identifies object instances in the database.
- `Query`: conditional fetching of objects of a certain type.

## Please let us know your feedback 

We want ObjectBox to be not only the fastest, but also the most Swift-friendly persistence solution.
