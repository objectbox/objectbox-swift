# ObjectBox Swift Database - swiftly persist objects and on-device vector database for iOS & macOS

Powerful & superfast database for Swift that's also easy to use. Persist Swift objects quickly and reliably on-device on
iOS and macOS.

## Demo code

```swift
// objectbox: entity
class Person {
    var id: Id = 0
    var firstName: String = ""
    var lastName: String = ""
    
    init() {}
    
    init(id: Id = 0, firstName: String, lastName: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
    }
}

let store = try Store(directoryPath: "person-db")
let box = store.box(for: Person.self)

var person = Person(firstName: "Joe", lastName: "Green")
let id = try box.put(person) // Create

person = try box.get(id)!    // Read

person.lastName = "Black"
try box.put(person)          // Update

try box.remove(person.id)    // Delete

let query = try box.query {  // Query
    Person.firstName == "Joe"
    && Person.lastName.startsWith("B")
}.build()
let people: [Person] = try query.find()
```

## Why use ObjectBox for Swift data persistence?

Simple but powerful; frugal but fast: The ObjectBox NoSQL database offers an intuitive Swift API that's easy to pick up,
fun to work with, and incredibly fast, making it sustainable in many ways. Its frugal recource use (CPU, memory, 
battery / power) makes ObjectBox an ideal and sustainable choice for iOS apps. So why not give it a try right away? 
Check out the [installation section below](#add-objectbox-to-your-project). You can also star this repository for later üåü

### Features

## Add ObjectBox to your project

ObjectBox is available as a

- [CocoaPods](#cocoapods) pod
- [Swift Package](https://swift.objectbox.io/install#swift-package)

### CocoaPods

If you are new to CocoaPods, [check out their website](https://cocoapods.org) for an introduction and installation 
instructions.

To add the ObjectBox Swift dependency, add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'ObjectBox'
```

Then install the pod and run the ObjectBox setup script:

```bash
pod install --repo-update
Pods/ObjectBox/setup.rb
```

The `setup.rb` script will configure your Xcode project to run ObjectBox generator on every build by adding a build 
phase (called "[OBX] Update Sourcery Generated Files") for every target with an executable.

**Disable the User Script Sandboxing** option in your Xcode project build settings to allow the ObjectBox generator 
script to run.

> [!NOTE]
> The ObjectBox code generator needs to run in the project directory and will generate files there. If this is executed
> in a sandbox, the build phase will fail.

Then, open your Xcode workspace (.xcworkspace) instead of the Xcode project (.xcodeproj).

Now, you are all set to define your first ObjectBox entities! To continue check the 
[Getting Started guide](https://swift.objectbox.io/getting-started) or [the example project](#example).

#### Troubleshoot setup issues

If installing the pod or configuring the project failed, try to update the xcodeproj and cocoapods gem:

```bash
gem update xcodeproj && gem update cocoapods && pod repo update
```

> [!NOTE]
> On Apple Silicon (M1), ensure you have the latest gems for CocoaPods:
> 
> `gem update ffi ethon`

#### Update to a new version

After a new version of ObjectBox Swift is released, update the ObjectBox pod and run the setup script again:

```bash
pod repo update
pod update ObjectBox
Pods/ObjectBox/setup.rb
```

### Swift Package

Instructions depend on whether you want to set up an Xcode project or a Swift Package Manager manifest.

#### Set up an Xcode project

In Xcode, [add a package dependency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) 
and search for the package URL:

```
https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-spm
```

For the Dependency Rule, we recommend to use "Up to Next Major Version". To find the latest 
version to use view the [tags of the objectbox-swift-spm repository](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-spm/tags).

Finally, when asked, add the `ObjectBox.xcframework` to your app target. Or to use 
[ObjectBox Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/) (requires access to the Sync feature), add the `ObjectBox-Sync.xcframework` 
instead.

Now, you are all set to define your first ObjectBox entities! To continue check the 
[Getting Started guide](https://swift.objectbox.io/getting-started) or [the example project](#example).

#### Set up a Swift Package Manager manifest

In your `Swift.package` file, add the ObjectBox Swift Package repository to the `dependencies` block:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-spm.git", from: "4.4.0"),
```

Add the `ObjectBox.xcframework` to the `dependencies` of the desired target in `targets`:

```swift
.product(name: "ObjectBox.xcframework", package: "objectbox-swift-spm")
```

Or to use [ObjectBox Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/) (requires access to the Sync feature), add the 
`ObjectBox-Sync.xcframework` instead:

```swift
.product(name: "ObjectBox-Sync.xcframework", package: "objectbox-swift-spm")
```

Your `Swift.package` file should then contain sections similar to this:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-spm.git", from: "<version>"),
],
targets: [
  .executableTarget(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "ObjectBox.xcframework", package: "objectbox-swift-spm")
    ],
]
```

Now, you are all set to define your first ObjectBox entities! To continue check the 
[Getting Started guide](https://swift.objectbox.io/getting-started) or [the example project](#example).

### Recommended Xcode project settings

ObjectBox Swift does not include Bitcode, so you may need to adjust "Build Settings" in Xcode accordingly. In that tab, 
ensure "All" is active and search for "bitcode". You will find the "Enable Bitcode" setting which you set to "No".

Otherwise, for some build targets, you will get a build error like this:

```
'.../ObjectBox.framework/ObjectBox' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting 
ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target.
```

## Example

In the [Example](Example) directory, you'll find a "Notes" example app demonstrating ObjectBox's Swift API.
The example comes with two apps: one for iOS and one for macOS. The iOS example is a full GUI application, whereas the 
macOS example runs a few operations and then exits.

## Changelog

For notable and important changes in new releases, read the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Development

The source code for ObjectBox's Swift binding can be found [in the Source folder](Source/README.md) of this repository.

## Background: code generation

ObjectBox Swift Database uses generated code for optimal performance at runtime by avoiding reflection etc.

It uses [a fork of Sourcery](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-generator) for this.

## Cross-platform database: Mobile, Desktop, Browser, Embedded, IoT

ObjectBox is a cross-platform database supporting sustainable app development in [multiple native languages](https://objectbox.io/dev-get-started/):

- [ObjectBox C and C++ SDK](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c): native speed with zero copy access to objects on embedded devices
- [ObjectBox Java and Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java): runs on Android, desktop, and servers.
- [ObjectBox Dart and Flutter SDK](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart): persist Dart objects & build cross-platform apps using Flutter.
- [ObjectBox Go SDK](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go): great for IoT, data-driven tools, and server applications.
  also enables porting ObjectBox to other languages.
