Swift Database - swiftly persist objects on iOS and macOS
===============

ObjectBox is a superfast, light-weight Swift database persisting Swift objects fast, easily, and fully ACID-compliant on-device on iOS and macOS.
On top, it comes with an [out-of-the-box Data Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/) handling the complexity of occassionally connected devices, networking and conflict resolution code for you. Build apps that reliably sync between devices and any backend, offline on-premise or online with the Cloud.

```swift
let santa = Person(firstName: "Santa", lastName: "Claus")
try personBox.put(santa)

let query: Query<Person> = personBox.query {
    return (Person.firstName.contains("Santa") || Person.age > 100)
           && Person.lastName.isEqual(to: "Claus") 
}.build()
let oldClauses = query.find()
```

<a name="cocoapods"></a>Adding ObjectBox to your project
--------------------------------------------------------
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is recommended to set up ObjectBox in your project.
See the [installation docs](https://swift.objectbox.io/install) for alternative setups,
or the [New to CocoaPods?](#new-to-cocoapods) section below for a quick intro.
To install the `ObjectBox` pod, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
  pod 'ObjectBox'
```

Then run this to install the ObjectBox framework:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/folder/ # whatever folder your Podfile is in.
pod install
Pods/ObjectBox/setup.rb myproject.xcodeproj # whatever your Xcode project is named
```

And, don't forget to close the Xcode project (.xcodeproj) and open the workspace (.xcworkspace) instead.
Now, you are all set to define your first ObjectBox entities;
e.g. check the [getting started guide](https://swift.objectbox.io/getting-started) or the [example](#example) described below. 

### <a name="new-to-cocoapods"></a>New to CocoaPods?

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager and sets up libraries like ObjectBox in your Xcode project.
To install it, run this in a terminal: 

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

In CocoaPods, you keep track of used libraries in a file called "Podfile".
If you don't have this file yet, navigate to your Xcode project folder and use CocoaPods to create one:

```bash
pod init
```

### CocoaPods troubleshooting

If `pod install` fails, try updating CocoaPods first:

    gem update xcodeproj && gem update cocoapods && pod repo update

### Swift versions

Here's a list of ObjectBox releases, and the Swift versions they were compiled with:

| ObjectBox version(s) | Swift version |
|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
|        1.5.0         |     5.3(.2)   |        
|        1.4.1         |      5.3      |        
|      1.3, 1.4.0      |      5.2      |        
|         1.2          |      5.1      |

This might be relevant, e.g. when using Carthage. For various reasons, we recommend using the latest version.

<a name="example"></a>Example
-----------------------------
In the [Example](Example/) directory, you'll find a "Notes" example app demonstrating ObjectBox's Swift API.
The example comes with two apps: one for iOS and one for macOS. The iOS example is a full GUI application, whereas the macOS example runs a few operations and then exits.

To setup the example, use CocoaPods to acquire the framework:

    cd Example/
    pod install # if that fails, update CocoaPods (see Installation)
    Pods/ObjectBox/setup.rb

This will generate a `NotesExample.xcworkspace` that you can launch to try out ObjectBox.

Background: code generation
---------------------------
ObjectBox Swift Database generates code at build time for optimal performance at runtime by avoiding reflection etc.
This is automatically done for you and should be transparent.
Internally, we use [a fork of Sourcery](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift-generator) for this.

Source code
-----------
Source code for ObjectBox's Swift binding can be found [in the Source folder](Source/README.md).

Already using ObjectBox?
---------------------------

We're on a mission to bring joy and delight to Mobile app developers. We want ObjectBox not only to be the fastest Swift database, but also the swiftiest Swift data persistence, making you enjoy coding with ObjectBox.

To do that, we want your feedback: what do you love? What's amiss? Where do you struggle in everyday app development?

**We're looking forward to receiving your comments and requests:**

Cross-platform database: Mobile, Desktop, Browser, Embedded, IoT
------------------------
ObjectBox is a cross-platform database supporting [multiple native languages](https://objectbox.io/dev-get-started/): 

* [ObjectBox Java/Kotlin Database](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java): runs on Android, desktop, and servers.
* [Golang Data Persistence](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go): great for IoT, data-driven tools, and server applications.
